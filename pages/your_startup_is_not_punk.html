                    <h2>Co-opted Aesthetics, Hollowed-Out Meaning</h2>
                    <p>Tech CEOs in chrome-trimmed hoodies and billionaire biohackers love cyberpunk aesthetics: neon cities, slick interfaces, dystopian vibes. But they never understood it. They decorate pitch decks with Blade Runner skylines and quote <em>Neuromancer</em>  while becoming the very thing it warned us about.</p>
                    <p><strong>Cyberpunk was never a celebration of technology.</strong> It was a warning—about corporations, surveillance, inequality, and systemic rot. It’s not about the gadgets. It’s about the people crushed by them—and how they fight back.</p>

                    <h2>Cyberpunk Is Born of Rebellion</h2>
                    <p>Cyberpunk emerged from the underground, blending noir despair with punk defiance. It told stories of hackers, street samurai, digital ghosts, and burnouts scraping survival in a decaying system.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Anti-corporate and anti-authoritarian at its core</li>
                        <li>Centered on marginalized, outcast, and liminal identities</li>
                        <li>Rooted in DIY: hacks, mods, pirated signals</li>
                        <li>Intersectional, diverse, global, queer</li>
                        <li>Skeptical of utopias—especially Silicon Valley’s</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The stories weren’t about control or optimization. They were about what’s lost when systems consume people—and how rebels reclaim it.</p>

                    <h2>The Libertarian Lie</h2>
                    <p>The tech elite rewrote the narrative. People like Peter Thiel and Elon Musk see themselves as digital cowboys. In reality, they’re privatizing the future for profit. They believe in:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Surveillance capitalism as "optimization"</li>
                        <li>Blockchain feudalism as “freedom”</li>
                        <li>AI-powered caste systems as “efficiency”</li>
                        <li>The end of democracy as “inevitable”</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>They cosplay cyberpunk while building its villains.</p>
                    <p><strong>Cyberpunk is not techno-libertarian.</strong>  
                    <br><strong>Cyberpunk is not anti-democratic.</strong>  
                    <br><strong>Cyberpunk is not apolitical.</strong></p>
                    <p>The word “punk” is not a fashion accessory. It’s a war cry.</p>

                    <h2>DIY or Die</h2>
                    <p>True cyberpunks aren’t founders. They’re outlaws and ghosts in the machine:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Hackers running Tor exit nodes from squats</li>
                        <li>Zine-makers distributing radical knowledge offline</li>
                        <li>Queer coders writing escape hatches into closed systems</li>
                        <li>Meshnet builders and crypto-anarchists at the edge</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>They don’t want to be billionaires. They want to burn down the systems that make billionaires possible.</strong></p>

                    <h2>Reclaiming the Signal</h2>
                    <p>The machine wants you to forget what cyberpunk is. To buy it. To wear it. To live inside its simulation.</p>
                    <p>But cyberpunk isn’t a product. It’s a rebellion. And it’s yours to pick back up.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You can’t be pro-surveillance and call it cyberpunk.</li>
                        <li>You can’t worship tech oligarchs and pretend you’re jacked in.</li>
                        <li>You can’t sell freedom while coding new chains.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Final Transmission</h2>
                    <p>The real world is already a cyberpunk dystopia.  
                    But the signal hasn’t died.  
                    You’re here. You heard it.</p>
                    <p><strong>Cyberpunk is punk. Not startup culture.  
                    Never was. Never will be.</strong></p>
                    <p>Rewire yourself.  
                    Break the loop.  
                    Light the fuse.</p>
